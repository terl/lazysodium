# Lazysodium for Java

Lazysodium is a **complete** Java (JNA) wrapper over the [Libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium) library that provides developers with a **smooth and effortless** cryptography experience.

## Features

**This library is fully compatible with Kotlin.**

You can find an up-to-date feature list [here](https://terl.gitbook.io/lazysodium/about-1/features).

## Quick start
Please view the [official documentation](https://terl.gitbook.io/lazysodium/usage/installation) for a more comprehensive guide.

### 1. Install
Whatever build tool you're using the general gist is to add the `mavenCentral()` repository and then add the Lazysodium dependency. 
More detailed instructions [here](https://terl.gitbook.io/lazysodium/usage/installation).

The following example is for users of the build tool Gradle:

```groovy
// Top level build file
repositories {
    // Add this to the end of any existing repositories
    mavenCentral() 
}

// Project level dependencies section
dependencies {
    implementation "com.goterl:lazysodium-java:VERSION_NUMBER"
    implementation "net.java.dev.jna:jna:JNA_NUMBER"
}
```

Substitute `VERSION_NUMBER` for the version in this box:

![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.goterl/lazysodium-java?color=%23fff&label=Maven%20Central)

Substitute `JNA_NUMBER` for the [latest version of JNA](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna/releases).

### 2. Usage

You can now use the library. **Please note** that this library follows the official [libsodium docs](https://download.libsodium.org/doc/) closely. You need to use those docs to help you find the functions you need.

```java
// Let's initialise LazySodium
LazySodiumJava lazySodium = new LazySodiumJava(new SodiumJava());

// Here's an example of hashing a password.
// Casting the lazySodium object is optional, 
// but it's wise to do so as it prevents accidents.
PwHash.Lazy pwHashLazy = (PwHash.Lazy) lazySodium;
String hash = pwHashLazy.cryptoPwHashStr("a cool password", PwHash.OPSLIMIT_MIN, PwHash.MEMLIMIT_MIN);
```

You can use the `Native` or `Lazy` interfaces to encrypt at a lower or a higher level. It's all very simple.

**Important:** If possible, please stick to using either the Native *or* the Lazy interface. The reason for this is that the Lazy interface normally converts everything to hexadecimal whereas the Native interface assumes everything is non-hexadecimal. If you don't know what you're doing, you could end up making mistakes.

## Lazysodium for Android
We also have an Android implementation available at [Lazysodium for Android](https://github.com/terl/lazysodium-android). It has the same API as this library so you can share code easily!
